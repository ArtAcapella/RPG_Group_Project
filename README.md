**Hacking RPG**

Text-Based RPG inspired by old pop-culture ideas of hacking! Our game will put the player in the shoes of a hacker who takes on various gigs/quests. Gameplay will involve typical RPG combat, narrative branches, and puzzles in some sort of cyberpunk/sci-fi world. Gameplay will also involve puzzles *satirizing 90's depictions of hacking*, and most of the story will also be a play on how pop culture represents hacking.
Traditional RPG mechanics will also be included! choices, branching narratives, dialogue, skills, abilities, items, factions, and the like are all potential aspects we're looking to add.
