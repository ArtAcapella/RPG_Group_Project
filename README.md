Description: Hacking RPG

Text-Based RPG inspired by old pop-culture ideas of hacking! Our game will put the player in the shoes of a hacker who takes on various gigs/quests. Gameplay will involve typical RPG combat, narrative branches, and puzzles in some sort of cyberpunk/sci-fi world. Gameplay will also involve puzzles satirizing 90's depictions of hacking.
